 Hey everybody, it’s Tuuuuuuuesday! I want a game that is nothing but kicking dumpsters at enemies. I’m just gonna say it, if you get shit on a carrot, you just throw it away. Don’t even try to salvage that carrot. Exécutable? What the fuck are you saying!? Seattle is actually Spanish for “taco.” I did not say, “uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.” I feel like I’m gonna throw up, but in a good way.

You’re just anti-people-believing-in-things. You’re talking about sex, right? They called us “charmingly garrulous”, which I couldn’t think of a more New Yorker thing to describe us as. Can we enhance this? Infinite beards. Suck on it, Ron Weasley.

Fuck your milk! This Quick Look is over! The laziest dubstep is arguably the best dubstep. It makes me angry how fucking much I enjoy this game. Because the Dutch are cheap. You are a human piece of shit.
